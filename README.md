## 📌 Project Overview
Our team is developing an autonomous "Mouse" to compete in the **National Robotics Challenge**. The robot must navigate a $10 \times 10$ unit square maze, mapping the environment in real-time to find the fastest path to the center.

### ⚖️ Competition Constraints (NRC Rules)
* **Size:** Max $7" \times 7" \times 7"$.
* **Time:** 10-minute total run time.
* **Autonomy:** No external communication once the maze layout is disclosed.
* **Scoring:** Based on the fastest run + search time penalties.
